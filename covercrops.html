<h2>Cover Crops</h2>

<IMG SRC="clover.jpg">

<p> On the farming side of plants it is important to have cover crops! Just like us humans need vitamins and nutirents to grow, so do plants! Every year when you plant a garden, the plants are take nutirens out of the soil to help grow! Occasionally we need to replenish to soil to help the new plants to grow nice and big! Cover crops do just that!</p>

<p>Crimson Clover is a good example of a cover crop and is used to put nitrogen into the soil! In addition, it is also important to rotate your crops and not monocrop!</p>
