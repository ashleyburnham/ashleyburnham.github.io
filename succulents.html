<h2>Succulents</h2>

<IMG SRC="succulents.jpg">

<p>Succulents are some of the easiest plants to keep alive if you know how to properly care for them. Succulents can vary in color, shape, size, and appearance. A good rule of thumb that I like to follow when it comes to watering a succulent is to lightly pinch a leaf, not enough to tear or hurt the plant, but enough to see how squishy it is. If the leaf feels firm you can walk away and leave it for another week or so depending on how hot and dry the soil is. If the leaf is squishy then you should water it until the leaks through the bottom of the pot it is in!</p>

<p>Succulents also love sunlight and should have a good amount of sunlight or they may try to reach for the light and end up looking more like a tree than a flat plant.</p>

<p>Succulent propogation, or creating a new baby succulent, is very easy as well! if you break a leaf off of the stem and set it on top of soil in the sun and then walk away it will start to develop roots and a whole new plant!</p>
